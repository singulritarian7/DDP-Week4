## Yellowstone National Park : Old Faithful Geyser 

Old Faithful Geyser, which is part of the Yellow Stone National Park, has been documented to erupt at a regular rate, and predicted to be the most reliable among its peers of other big geysers.  It is not the biggest or the most regular geyser in Yellowstone National Park, however, it is the most famous.  In fact, it is believed that its regularity is does not correlate to any other hydrothermal features within the Yellow Stone Park sector.

## Old Faithful Geyser

```{r eruptions}
n_breaks <- 15;bw_adjust <- 1
colors <- length(ggplot2:::bin_breaks_width(range(faithful), width = bw_adjust)$breaks) - 1L
hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(n_breaks),
     xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser Eruption Duration", col = colors)
dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = bw_adjust);lines(dens, col = "red")
```
